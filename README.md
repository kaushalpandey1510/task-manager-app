# Task Manager App

This project is a **Task Manager** application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It enables users to create, edit, and delete tasks with specific titles, dates, and descriptions. All task data is saved locally using `localStorage`, ensuring persistence across browser sessions.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Create new tasks with a title, date, and description.
- **Edit Tasks**: Modify existing tasks.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Persistence**: Tasks are stored in `localStorage` for persistence across page reloads.
- **Validation**: Ensures tasks have a title before being added or updated.
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Prompts the user before closing the form with unsaved changes.

  "description": "Task Description"
}
```
